                    Pachmarhi is the only hill station and is the highest point in Madhya Pradesh. Pachmarhi is also often known as "Satpura ki Rani" or the "Queen of the Satpura Range". Situated at an altitude of 1,067 metres, the picturesque town is a part of UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, home to leopards and bison.

                    Five sandstone cut caves on the hilltop are believed to be the spot where Pandavas stayed in Pachmarhi during their exile, making it a popular spot among religious tourists. Being at an elevated height and surrounded by bewitching forests of the Satpuras with the streams and waterfalls, Pachmarhi is a perfect weekend getaway from the nearby cities of Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. Since the town was discovered and developed in modern times by Captain James Forsyth of the British Army, it houses charming churches built in colonial style architecture.

                    This grand Gwalior Fort sprawls over an area of nearly 3 sq. km. Its height is more than 10 m. The iconic fort built on a hilltop offers a spectacular 360-degree view of the landscape around it. You will also catch glimpses of massive water tanks that were specifically designed to store water for weeks and months.

                    The magnificent structure is mainly constructed with sandstones. However, the numerous temples and palaces built inside exhibit other materials as well. One of the most famous architectural gems you wouldnâ€™t want to miss is the Teli ka Mandir, which is completely built in the ancient Dravidian style and is beautifully sculpted.
